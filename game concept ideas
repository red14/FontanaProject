Game concept and ideas

my idea for Starship Fontana is to use sprites of a wide winged spaceship as the player, against small enemys moving down in a line formation and when one is hit for it to respawn back at the top, with the collectible coins to be repesented with a bright light that is very hard to catch but very rewarding when you do, with a line of asteroids to act as a barrier that moves down the screen, i also plan to have a rotating back ground to give a better impression of movement.
